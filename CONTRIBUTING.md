# Setup instructions

* Install [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io) globally
* Create a virtual environment in the directory up from this one
e.g.
```
cd ..
virtualenv venv
```
Inside this repo run:
```
./setup
```

You'll need to setup a channel key inside ifttt.cfg

```
CHANNEL_KEY='my-secret'
```
# Running

Get the server up and running you can edit app.py and uncomment the debug lines.

```
source ../venv/bin/activate
python app.py
```

Send a post request to verify things are working:
```
curl -d "" -X POST http://localhost:5000/v1/test/setup
curl -d "" -X POST http://localhost:5000/v1/triggers/picture_of_the_day
```

# Triggers

Triggers are defined in `ifttt/triggers.py`.
Triggers are exposed at `http://localhost:5000/v1/triggers/<trigger name>`
	where trigger name is either explicitly added via url_pattern or generated from the class name in snake case. e.g. `PictureOfTheDay` becomes `picture_of_the_day`

A trigger is either JSON based (`BaseTriggerView`) or feed based (`BaseFeaturedFeedTriggerView`).

Create a trigger in `ifttt/triggers.py` and expose it in `ifttt/core.py`.

## Trigger fields

Trigger fields can be customised like so:

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d '{"triggerFields":{"hrs":"2"}}' -X POST http://localhost:5000/v1/triggers/trending_topics
```

## Channel config

Note the `channel_config.yaml` file needs to be manually loaded into IFTTT. It lives in this repo purely for tracking purposes.
